            <div id="Who" class="content">
                Someone named Aiden, who happened to post on afewmaneuvers back in 2012. Since then, the module has seen some work from Buhallin in early 2013 to add some needed features (ship moves with right click menu). The modules are now maintained by Mu0n since August/September of 2013 (wave 3, firing arc corrections, length corrections, imperial aces, wave 4, transport, corvette, etc.), with help from theorist, chris B. for art, sigzog for helper ref cards, radarman5 for ship art, gabriel for map packs and silentubiquity for map packs + ship pictures + squad logfiles + side table logfile. A huge set of programmed features (that brought squad autospawn, overlapping backtracking, etc) appeared in early 2017 thanks to the tremendous help from ajmath, haslo, Guido Kessels, yours truly, and many others.

                <p>That's it. Really. That's the only mandatory file. It contains a few 3x3 starfield maps (classic, light and deep), a teal nebula map (formerly known as blue nebula) and then a bunch of standard black maps (3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 3x6 and 6x3). It contains all ships, pilots, upgrades, tokens, dials currently released in its counterpart tabletop game, and then some, as previews from FFG filter out information to us. Vassal is a great way to try out some of the unreleased, but spoiled stuff from the game.
                <p>If you want more variety for the maps, there's an optional map pack found in the X-Wing Vassal download page (where you got the module): Universal_Map_Pack_1.0.vmdx

            <div id="update" class="content">
                The first step is to remember where you put the module files. If you forgot, there's an easy way. Open up Vassal's launcher window, and do a mouse-over on the module file. A blue popup field will appear and show you the location of the module file, like so:
                <p><img src="./img/directory.png">
                <p>
                    The second step is to simply delete the old .vmod file, which has this appearance:
                <p><img src="./img/moduleIcon.png">
                <p>The third step is to download the new file (from the page whose link is under "How to install the x-wing vassal modules for the first time") in that same location.
                <p>
                    The fourth step is to go into the vassal launcher window, go to File/Open Module...
                <p><img src="./img/openModule.png">
                <p>Vassal will then attempt to launch the module - close those new windows and go back to the launcher.
                <p>
                    The fifth step is to add the map extensions by right clicking your module name in the launcher window and selecting "Add Extension..."
                <p><img src="./img/addExtension.png">
                <p>Do this for all map extensions.

This popup will display the current version, the newer version and contain a link to the x-wing vassal module download page. Follow it and update!
                It's fairly important to update your module version ASAP. Sometimes, some game pieces or mechanism will behave strangely as bugs are fixed and features added.

                In order to manipulate X-Wing ships, tokens and do anything of substance, you need to be a numbered player inside a game room. When you first log into the X-Wing Vassal server, you're a generic user inside the 'Main Room'.

            <div id="spawn" class="content">
                Spawning a squad is done with some help from the known squad builder websites found online. These are a few of the more important ones which are supported:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://geordanr.github.io/xwing/">(Yet Another) X-Wing Miniatures Squad Builder (aka YASB)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://xwing-builder.co.uk/build">X-Wing Squadron Builder (aka voidstate)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://x-wing.fabpsb.net/">Fab's Squadron Builder</a></li>
                </ul>
                Build a list with these squadrons. Be in a vassal game room, as a numbered player. Open your numbered player window (button showing up as a yellow number on a black square). Click on the Squad Spawn button. Paste your squad's URL. Your squad will spawn inside your player's window.

            <div id="values" class="content">
                When you use the automatic squad spawn, all the stats are normally all entered in. However, there are game effects which alter the stats, so it's good to know how to change these things (including damage reducing your health)
                Everything can be done in the slowly, but surely way of right clicking on ships and adjusting all the values, one by one:
                <p><img src="./img/editingShip.png">
                <p>Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcuts to do this much faster.
                <ul>
                    <li>Alt-<b>P</b> to increase pilot skill; Ctrl-Alt-<b>P</b> to decrease pilot skill</li>
                    <li>Alt-<b>A</b> to increase attack rating; Ctrl-Alt-<b>A</b> to decrease attack rating</li>
                    <li>Alt-<b>D</b> to increase defense rating; Ctrl-Alt-<b>D</b> to decrease defense rating</li>
                    <li>Alt-<b>H</b> to increase hull rating; Ctrl-Alt-<b>H</b> to decrease hull rating</li>
                    <li>Alt-<b>S</b> to increase shield rating; Ctrl-Alt-<b>S</b> to decrease shield rating</li>
                    <li>Shift-<b>N</b> to add a ship name visible on the token at the top left</li>
                    <li>Shift-<b>P</b> to add a second/alternate ship name visible on the token at the bottom, much smaller</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Important:</b> you can always clone a ship by clicking on it (left mouse button), hitting Ctrl-C, then dragging the copy away from the original. This saves time when you have multiples of a ship type in a squad.

                <p>The proper way to use the dials during the planning and activation phases of the game is the following:
                <p><ul>
                <li>Changing the maneuvers of a dial while it's in the map window will trigger an anti-cheating warning message in the main window, therefore...</li>
                <li>(planning phase) ...you have to change your dials inside your personal player hand window</li>
                <li>Make sure the dial is hidden with Ctrl-R. This is what your own dial will look like while hidden. A ship icon appears in the top left corner <img src="./img/dialHiddenView1.png"></li>
                <li>This is what your hidden dial will look like to your opponent: <img src="./img/dialHiddenView2.png"></li>
                <li>Use '.' and ',' to cycle through the available moves.</li>
                <li>When ready, bring your dials (still hidden) on the map window, besides your ships and declare you're ready in the chat window. Most players use the word "set". <img src="./img/set.png"></li>
                <li>(activation phase) Respecting play order with regard to ascending pilot skill activation, reveal a dial with the same shortcut, Ctrl-R and activate your ship (see next item).
            </ul>
                <p>Some players enjoy rotating the dials, as it gives you an easier time to visualize the proper direction for turning ships when they're facing downward, for example. Do this by clicking on the dial and hitting the left or right arrow keys.

            <a href="#action">How do I declare what actions my ships do? (activation phase)</a>
            <div id="action" class="content">
                There are two ways to do this:
                <p>Way #1: more tedious, but more intuitive. If you used the automatic squad spawn feature inside your player window, you should normally have all the tokens associated with the actions that your ships are capable of. If, for some reason, some are lost or missing, you can always spawn some more from the Pieces window, Chits/Tokens tab. This is tedious because you'll have to manually put tokens during the activation phase, then take out every unused focus and evade tokens during the end phase. There is a faster way.
                <p>Way #2: (<b>heartily recommended</b>) Ships have space for 3 "action declarations". As always, you have access to this in their right click contextual menus, but here are the shortcuts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Shift-A to cycle through the first line of potential ship actions. Shift-Z to remove it without have to cycle it out.</li>
                    <li>Ctrl-A to cycle through the first line of potential ship actions. Ctrl-Z to remove it</li>
                    <li>Shift-Ctrl-A to cycle through the third line of potential ship actions. Shift-Ctrl-Z to remove it</li>
                    <li>Alt-Ctrl-Shift-Z to remove all actions (up to 3) at once.</li>
                </ul>
                As an example, Darth Vader (in a TIE Advanced x1) with push the limit can easily go up to 3 actions during a turn and would use all three 'lines'.

To remove all stress at once, hit Ctrl-Shift-Alt-S. For other ship status condition tokens, check the right click menu, or go find the shortcuts in the "How To & Shortcuts" button, under the "Ship Stats and Status" section, "Small & Large Ships" item.
                <p>Alternatively, if you used the Squad Spawn feature (heatily recommended), you will receive at least 1 stress token per ship. You can drag and drop those around. You can increase its value with Shift-S and decrease it with Ctrl-Shift-S.
                <p>If, for some reason, you lost all your stress tokens, you can go to the Pieces Window, under the Chits/Tokens tabs and spawn some more.</p>

            <div id="damage" class="content">
                Most players keep track of it on the map itself, directly on the ships. You can adjust the relevant ship stats using these shortcuts:
                <p><ul>
                <li>Decrease shield value: Ctrl-Alt-S (Alt-S to increase in case you go too far)</li>
                <li>Decrease Hull value: Ctrl-Alt-H (Alt-H to increase in case you go too far)</li>
            </ul>
                <p>When you take damage to the hull (past shields), the game expects you to draw damage cards. Each player can spawn their own damage deck to their player window, then drag and drop cards from it, to their respective player hands as damage accumulates on the ship. This is on top of modifying the ship values on the ship pieces on the map.
                <p>As for critical damage, it is customary to draw the appropriate card on the map, flip it (Ctrl-F) there and wait for some acknowledgement from your opponent. On the map, every player can then mouse-hover the card and see a zoomed version of it, allowing to read it easily. If you spawn and flip the card in your player hand window instead, only you can benefit from the mouse-hover zoom.

                If you instead moved standalone tokens (ie provided from the automatic squad spawn), you will have to manually remove them from the play area. This is why using the action bars is so much more quicker than spawning and dragging around multiple token chits manually.

            <div id="logsave" class="content">
                <p>In order to save a log of a game, you must start the recording of the log before the game starts. This is done with the File Menu/Begin logfile. When you're ready to end it, go to File Menu/End Logfile.</p>
                <p>In order to load a log of a game, first, make sure you're in a game room. Next, without needing to create a new game in that room, you can directly open your log with File Menu/Load Continuation and pick your log file (.vsave file format). In order to step through the log, you must click on the right oriented arrow button in the chat window toolbar. Once you've clicked at least once on that button, you can optionally step through using the Page Down key. To step rapidly through the log during slow moments, you can hold down the Page Down key.</p>

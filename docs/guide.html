            <a href="#Who">Who made the x-wing vassal module?</a>
            <div id="Who" class="content">
				<p>2012: a user member of afewmaneuvers (now a defunct and long gone community) named 'Aiden Douglass' started the module late in the year.
				<p>2013: soon abandoned, Buhallin added some time-saving features such as preprogrammed movements from the ship right click menu (ships had to be dragged/dropped/rotated from manually placed templates before)
				<p>Mu0n took over the module in September to add wave 3 of the first edition and has taken the helm ever since
				<p>2014: Consolidation into a single module file, added first edition epic ships. Overhaul of ship token design.
				<p>2015: Bomb Spawner, barrel roll management
				<p>2016: Overhaul of ship token design. New scum faction.
				<p>2017: Mu0n figures out with some help from sozin how to add a custom java function to the module - ajmath, haslo, Guido Kessels quickly add automatic ship bump resolution and squad spawning. Later in the year, Mu0n adds firing autoranges
				<p>2018: Mu0n makes the module get automatic content updates from the web (existing sources + new ones of his making). Second Edition hits and much of the last years of work has to be redone, another overhaul of ship design, 7 factions taken care of with their own colors, tons of arcs added, internal squadron builder added. Spawn token management taken off module in a web databank.
				<p>2019: Dials with automatic movement and the escrow squad spawn is added, mouse interface for ships replaces TONS of keyboard shortcuts for movement, repositioning, etc. Remotes have their own mouse interface as well.

            <div id="empty" class="content">
                Players are encouranged to keep supporting Fantasy Flight Games (the creators of X-Wing Miniatures) and that they treat vassal as a complementary way to play the game rather than the main way and prevent any unfortunate loss of business. That being said, as other ways of playing X-Wing proliferated on personal computers, the censorship of cards seemed unnnecessary and was lifted for the Vassal module in 2018 at the onset of Second Edition.

                Alternatively, you can go to the vassalengine x-wing module download page: <a href="http://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:Star_Wars:_X-Wing_Miniatures_Game">http://www.vassalengine.org/wiki/Module:Star_Wars:_X-Wing_Miniatures_Game</a><p>

                </ul>
                <p>Where the 'x.x.x' is the latest version number. That's it. Really. That's the only mandatory file. It contains a few 3x3 starfield maps (classic, light and deep), a teal nebula map (formerly known as blue nebula) and then a bunch of standard black maps (3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 3x6 and 6x3). It contains all ships, pilots, upgrades, tokens, dials currently released in its counterpart tabletop game, and then some, as previews from FFG filter out information to us. Vassal is a great way to try out some of the unreleased, but spoiled stuff from the game.
                <p>If you want more variety for the maps, there's an optional map pack found in the X-Wing Vassal download page (from the vassalengine website): Universal_Map_Pack_1.0.vmdx. Most people don't have this additional pack and therefore can't profit from its usage even if you do use it.

            <div id="go" class="content">
                Anywhere that's convenient to you. Vassal does NOT impose any special location on your computer.
				<p>However, many Windows users report a problem whenever the module file is installed in either 1) a network folder or 2) inside the /program files/ directory structure (such as inside the location of the vassal client program).
				<p>The reason: the Vassal module uses a downloaded copy of the game data to keep things as current as possible and needs to be able to write in the same folder as where the module is located. You may have to edit the writing permissions of Java, or find a better location if this is a problem. The issue is discussed in this thread: <a href="https://github.com/Mu0n/XWVassal/issues/252">https://github.com/Mu0n/XWVassal/issues/252</a>
                <p>For ease of use and to find your files easily in the future, you can create a
                    folder inside \My Documents\, <br>for example: \My Documents\Vassal\

            <div id="update" class="content">
                The first step is to remember where you put the module files. If you forgot, there's an easy way. Open up Vassal's launcher window, and do a mouse-over on the module file. A blue popup field will appear and show you the location of the module file, like so:
                <p><img src="./img/directory.png">
                <p>
                    The second step is to simply delete the old .vmod file, which has this appearance:
                <p><img src="./img/moduleIcon.png">
                <p>The third step is to download the new file (from the page whose link is under "How to install the x-wing vassal modules for the first time") in that same location.
                <p>
                    The fourth step is to go into the vassal launcher window, go to File/Open Module...
                <p><img src="./img/openModule.png">
                <p>Vassal will then attempt to launch the module - close those new windows and go back to the launcher.

                When you attempt to log onto the X-Wing Vassal server and if there's a new version available, a small popup will appear at the start of the logging process. This popup will display the current version, the newer version and contain a link to the x-wing vassal module download page. Follow it and update!
                It's fairly important to update your module version ASAP. Sometimes, some game pieces or mechanism will behave strangely as bugs are fixed and features added.

            <div id="spawn" class="content">
                Spawning a squad is done with some help from the known squad builder websites found online. These are a few of the more important ones which are supported:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://raithos.github.io/">(Yet Another) X-Wing Miniatures Squad Builder (aka YASB2)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://squadbuilder.fantasyflightgames.com/">Official X-Wing Squadron Builder from FFG</a></li>
                </ul>
                Build a list with these squadrons. Be in a vassal game room (as in, not in the main room but one that was created by you or your would-be opponent), as a numbered player. Open your numbered player window (button showing up as a yellow number on a black square). Click on the '2.0 Squad Spawn' button. Use that window's Method 1 and clear its texbox with its associated 'Clear' button. Paste your squad's URL in the now emptied textbox. Click on the 'Spawn Squad from URL' button. Your squad will spawn inside your player's window.
				<p><img src="./img/sesquadspawn.png">
				<p>Alternatively, you can spawn a squad with the xws format (Method 2), which is shared by many squad builders/apps in the community. Follow the instructions on how to do so in the Squad Spawn window itself.
				<p>Alternatively, you can create and then spawn your own squad using the internal squad builder, which allows mixed faction squads, illegal upgrade slots for ships, etc. This is the only way to create and use wacky combinations that are not allowed in the official ways to play the game.  This is for custom game mode scenarios.

                When you use the automatic squad spawn, the Initiative, Shield, Hull, Charge (when applicable) and Force Charge (when applicable) are normally all entered in. However, there are game effects which alter the stats, so it's good to know how to change these things (including damage reducing your health)
                The easiest way to edit those values is to invoke the ship mouse interface by holding down the ctrl key and left clicking on the ship (assuming it is on the playing map area).
                <p><img src="./img/shipmousegui.png">
				<p>To close the ship mouse interface, click on the big center X or the smaller red x at the center top. Only one ship mouse interface can be opened at once and a given player can only see one's own mouse ship interface.
                <p>Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcuts to do it a little faster
                <ul>
                    <li>Alt-<b>P</b> to increase initiative rating; Ctrl-Alt-<b>P</b> to decrease initiative rating</li>

                    <li>Alt-<b>S</b> to increase shield rating; Ctrl-Alt-<b>S</b> to decrease shield rating</li>
                    <li>Shift-<b>C</b> to increase charge rating; Ctrl-Shift-<b>C</b> to decrease charge rating</li>

                <p><img src="./img/sedialRevealed.png">
                <p>The proper way to use the dials during the planning and activation phases of the game is the following:
                <p><ul>
                <li>Changing the maneuvers of a dial while it's in the map window will trigger an anti-cheating warning message in the main window, therefore...</li>
                <li>(planning phase) ...you have to change your dials inside your personal player hand window</li>
                <li>Make sure the dial is hidden with Ctrl-R. This is what your own dial will look like while hidden. A ship icon appears in the top left corner <img src="./img/sedialHiddenView1.png"></li>
                <li>This is what your hidden dial will look like to your opponent: <img src="./img/sedialHiddenView2.png"></li>
                <li>Use '.' and ',' to cycle through the available moves.</li>
                <li>When ready, bring your dials (still hidden) on the map window, besides your ships and declare you're ready in the chat window. Most players use the word "set". There's also a button inside your player window that can be clicked so that a 'set' message is automatically generated in the chat window.</li>
                <li>(activation phase) Respecting play order with regard to ascending initiative rating activation, reveal a dial with Ctrl-S (known as "super reveal") to reveal the dial AND move the ship automatically. If you don't wish to move the ship as you reveal the dial, you can merely do CTRL-R to it.
            </ul>
                <p>Some players enjoy rotating the dials, as it gives you an easier time to visualize the proper direction for turning ships when they're facing downward, for example. Do this by clicking on the dial and hitting the left or right arrow keys.

            <a href="#action">How do I declare what actions my ships do? (activation phase)</a>
            <div id="action" class="content">
                There are two ways to do this:
                <p>Way #1: more tedious, but more intuitive. If you used the automatic squad spawn feature inside your player window, you should normally have all the tokens associated with the actions that your ships are capable of. If, for some reason, some are lost or missing, you can always spawn some more from the Pieces window, Chits/Tokens tab. This is tedious because you'll have to manually put tokens during the activation phase, then take out every unused focus and evade tokens during the end phase. There is a faster way.
                <p>Way #2: (<b>heartily recommended</b>) Ships have space for 3 "action declarations". As always, you have access to this in their right click contextual menus, but here are the shortcuts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Shift-A to cycle through the first line of potential ship actions. Shift-Z to remove it without have to cycle it out.</li>
                    <li>Ctrl-A to cycle through the first line of potential ship actions. Ctrl-Z to remove it</li>
                    <li>Shift-Ctrl-A to cycle through the third line of potential ship actions. Shift-Ctrl-Z to remove it</li>
                    <li>Alt-Ctrl-Shift-Z to remove all actions (up to 3) at once.</li>
                </ul>
                As an example, Darth Vader (in a TIE Advanced x1) with push the limit can easily go up to 3 actions during a turn and would use all three 'lines'.

                Click on a ship and hit Shift-S to increase the stress by 1 with a small icon at the side of your ship and it can go up to 4. To decrease the stress count, hit Ctrl-Shift-S. To remove all stress at once, hit Ctrl-Shift-Alt-S. For other ship status condition tokens, check the right click menu, or go find the shortcuts in the "How To & Shortcuts" button, under the "Ship Stats and Status" section, "Small & Large Ships" item.
                <p>Alternatively, if you used the Squad Spawn feature (heatily recommended), you will receive at least 1 stress token per ship. You can drag and drop those around. You can increase its value with Shift-S and decrease it with Ctrl-Shift-S.
                <p>If, for some reason, you lost all your stress tokens, you can go to the Pieces Window, under the Chits/Tokens tabs and spawn some more.</p>

            <div id="damage" class="content">
                Most players keep track of it on the map itself, directly on the ships. You can adjust the relevant ship stats using these shortcuts:
                <p><ul>
                <li>Decrease shield value: Ctrl-Alt-S (Alt-S to increase in case you go too far)</li>
                <li>Decrease Hull value: Ctrl-Alt-H (Alt-H to increase in case you go too far)</li>
            </ul>
                <p>When you take damage to the hull (past shields), the game expects you to draw damage cards. Each player can spawn their own damage deck to their player window, then drag and drop cards from it, to their respective player hands as damage accumulates on the ship. This is on top of modifying the ship values on the ship pieces on the map.
                <p>As for critical damage, it is customary to draw the appropriate card on the map, flip it (Ctrl-F) there and wait for some acknowledgement from your opponent. On the map, every player can then mouse-hover the card and see a zoomed version of it, allowing to read it easily. If you spawn and flip the card in your player hand window instead, only you can benefit from the mouse-hover zoom.

                If you used the ship side action icons (Shift-A, Ctrl-A, etc.): Click on "Reset Actions" at the top of the map window. This will clear all actions on all ships.
                If you instead moved standalone tokens (ie provided from the automatic squad spawn), you will have to manually remove them from the play area. This is why using the action bars is so much more quicker than spawning and dragging around multiple token chits manually.

currentVersion: contains only the numeric version number (newest publicly available one), nothing else. It's used by the X-Wing vassal module to verify if the user's version is different from the officially available version.

currentBlog: contains a link to a blog post containing details about the latest version, typically written and hosted on Team Covenant

VassalNews: the small news blurb that appears in the chat window whenever users log onto Vassal with the X-Wing Module.

April 30th, 2018 X-Wing Vassal news

The X-Wing Vassal League home website is now officially live at this address: http://xwvassal.info

The new TIE Reaper stuff can now be used by the vassal module (no new module download required). Not all squad builders support these new items yet (but soon). Since the dial is known, the TIE Reaper is functional right away in Vassal. Placeholder images have to be used for now.

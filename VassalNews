June 2nd, 2019 X-Wing Vassal news

The Unofficial X-Wing Vassal League home website HAS CHANGED to this address: https://listfortress.com/league
SEASON 7 HAS ENDED. SEASON 8 is in prep/brainstorm mode

Due to an update from FFG's intellectual property guidelines pdf available at https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/fa/b1/fab15a15-94a6-404c-ab86-6a3b0e77a7a0/ip_policy_031419_final_v21.pdf this vassal module will no longer carry copyrighted card images (pilots, upgrades, etc.). The module will most likely get a name change to reflect that this is fanmade and not endorsed by FFG, ie "Unofficial X-Wing Vassal Module".

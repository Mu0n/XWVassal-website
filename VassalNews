--Recorded games (logfiles) will stack on the autorange firing options lines throughout the match without ever removing them
--ALT-H shouldn't been used for Tallon Roll 1 right, it's in conflict with Hull+1 ship stat altering...
--The last items that are missing are the graphics for the Scrambled and Optimized Prototype condition tokens. You'll be able to have them inside the next version of the module.

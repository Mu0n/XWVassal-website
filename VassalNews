The X-Wing Vassal League home website is now officially live at this address: http://xwvassal.info

*** New released hotfix (a day after v8.0.8, we get v8.0.9) to solve the autospawn bug where loading a squad URL yielded no response and no squad

Test out 2.0 proxy squads by typing 'tcdemo1' and 'tcdemo2' in the autospawn (requires v8.0.8 of the module)

Known issues: 
--Recorded games (logfiles) will stack on the autorange firing options lines throughout the match without ever removing them
